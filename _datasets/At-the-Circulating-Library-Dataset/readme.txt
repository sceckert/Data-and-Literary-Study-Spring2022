Created by Troy J. Bassett, Purdue University Fort Wayne

Version 8.0

This snapshot was made on 7 January 2022 and consists of three files:

1. authors.csv: Lists all of the authors currently in the database with fields for author_id, first_name, middle_name, last_name, alt_name, birth_year, death_year, and gender.  Please note, the alt_name field is a catch-all field for familiar, legal, and maiden names as well as pseudonyms and titles.

In general, authors are listed under their legal names.  In some cases, however, authors are listed under pseudonyms or titles if those names are better known (e.g., George Eliot).  The author "Anonymous" is a catch-all for unattributed titles.

The codes for gender are female (F), male (M), and unknown (U).

There are a total of 5,032 author entries.

2. titles.csv: Lists all of the titles currently in the database with fields for title_id, author_id, title, volumes, publisher_location, publisher_name, and publication_year.  Please note, the author_id field is keyed to the author_id field in the authors.csv file.

In general, titles are first British editions.  To be included, the titles must be at least 90 pages long, though there may be a handful of exceptions.  Children's literature and foreign-language literature is excluded.

There are a total of 22,215 title entries.

    "## What is Named Entity Recognition?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Named Entity Recognition\" (NER) is a form of **natural language processing (NLP)** ––that is, the use of computational methods to study \"natural language\" or language that has evolved through human use. \n",
    "\n",
    "NER is one techniqued used to extract information from a set of texts using machine learning. Rather than looking for paricular words––like all appearances of the word \"London\" in Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, this technique of machine reading training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've encountered named entity recognition (NER) before: Elson, Dames, and McKeown, in [\"Extracting Social Networks from Literary Fiction,\"](https://princeton.instructure.com/courses/6331/files?preview=1351449) use NER to extract character names (see pages 141-142).  Matthew Wilkens, in [\"The Geographic Imagination of Civil-War-Era American Fiction,\"](https://princeton.instructure.com/courses/6331/files?preview=1351450) uses NER to extract city, state, and country names from his corpus of American fiction (see page 833). Both projects use the [Stanford NER](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html), a named entity recognizer developed by Jenny Finkel and trained on a corpus of tagged [Reuters](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/) and [Wall Street Journal](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2003T13) articles (for more on how the model was trained, see the [\"Models\" section of the Stanfor NER page](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/CRF-NER.html)). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this week, we're going to see natural language processing algorithm identifies as a place. We're going to use the [named entity recognition model](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#named-entities) from the [`spaCy` library](https://spacy.io/usage/spacy-101/#whats-spacy)."

    "![image](../_images/spacy-pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Named entity recognition is a particular kind of supervised machine learning, which starts by deciding on a set number of categories for entities––these are **labels**. \n",
    "+ Then, researchers develop a set of texts (usually at least a few hudnred)––this is (**training dataset**. They they go through these texts, carefully labeling (or \"tagging\") words within each text that fit the categories of named entities (eg persons, places, dates). \n",
    "+ A statistical **machine learning algorithm** is trained on this dataset––learning how to recognize entities by predicting them based on examples of text and labeled examples in the training data. This training process is done iteratively: examining the labels  and their frequencies within the corpus, learned to predict and assign weights to probability that a given text might fit a lablel, correcting the weights assigned to them, as the algorithm develops a model that might be generalized.\n",
    "+ The statistical **model** produced by the algorithm is then compared to a new dataset (an \"evaluation dataset\") that is different from the training dataset. To evaluate how well a model performs, a sample of the evaluation data is checked by hand, with humans verifying how well the model performed at correctly tagging entities, and recording how much the model misssed).\n",

    "A **machine learning algorithm** is a set of algorithms that \"learn\" or update based on a sample \"training dataset\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A **label** (or \"tag\") is an annotation added by a human to a dataset. For instance, in a training dataset for NER, a human might annnotate with tags around all words that they classify as PERSONS or DATES in a text. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **training dataset** is a large (at least 100 documents) set of texts used to traing a statistical model to recognize and identify or label parts of text. \n",

    "An **evaluation dataset**: is a different dataset from the training datset used to evaluate how well the model performs at the task (be it recognizing named entities or recognizing parts-of-speech in a text).\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical **model** takes an input and produces an output to produce a mathematical representation of assumptions about predicted patterns in observed data. A model is generated by an initial learning algorithm and which can be used to predict patterns (like classificaitons) in a dataset.\n",

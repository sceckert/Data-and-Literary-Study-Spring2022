# Short Paper Assignment


For your short paper assignment, I'll ask that you write one 5-6 page  (double-spaced) paper. This will develop out of a research practicum of your choice by extending the research exercise through application (that is, applying one of the methods that we've learned) or analysis (that is, developing an argument *about* a method/tool/or interface). Going further the research exercises, this short paper should apply a method learned to make an argumentative claim, either about a dataset, method, project, or interface. For instance, you might choose to work with the same dataset (or resources) as the original assignment. Or you might choose to work with a new dataset (I'd recommend looking at the resources on [this list of datasets](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/blob/main/_datasets/datasets.md)). 

This paper should develop a thesis, though the claims and arguments you make can be about the method. For instance: 

+ Your paper might advance an argument drawing on your findings in exploratory data analysis. For instance, you might try some of the `pandas` methods for working with tabular data to one of our datasets on lending library records and develop an argument about the patterns you notice in what you learn about the data (and about what might be missing in that dataset)
+ Your paper might take a meta-critical: developing an argument *about* the the method of reading itself (you might, for instance, write something like a meta-argument about the structure of a dataset, or the forms of command line reading (with methods `grep` and `wc`)
+ Or your paper might be some combination of applying the research method *and* reflecting on it!

For a reminder, all of our lessons are available here in this ["Course Resources" table of contents](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/blob/main/_resources/Course-Resources.md)

You will choose the date that the short paper is due––I recommend turning it in before the week after spring break, to give time for feedback. Papers should be submitted via email.

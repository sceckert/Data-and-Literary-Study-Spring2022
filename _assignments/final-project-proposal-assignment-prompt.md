# Final Project Proposal 

The [final project](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/tree/main/_assignments/final-project-assignment-prompt.md) proposal is the first stage of the project. It will take the form of a short write-up that will clearly and concretely describe your questions, data, methods and plan for the next few weeks.

- What are your research questions?
- What scholarly conversations does your research draw upon and further? (This could be digital humanities scholarship, or broader questions in literary studies, literary history, or a relevant humanities field)
- What [dataset(s)](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/blob/main/_datasets/datasets.md) will you be working with? 
- How you will translate your research questions into hypotheses?
- Which [methods](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/blob/main/_resources/Course-Resources.md) do you plan to use?
- How do you plan to communicate your results? 

This write-up should be **2-3 pages** and should lay the groundwork for the project, including a **timeline** to completion and **how you plan to divide the work** required to make the project.



NOTE: "Project" is deliberately left open-ended. Your project's "results" could be preliminary exploratory data analysis and your communication forum could be a visualization or a poster (or a simple GitHub website). For instructions on how to to set up and use Git or GitHubfor doing collaborative analytical work on your projects and for sharing your results, see this tutorial: [https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/blob/main/_resources/introduction-to-git-and-github.md](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/blob/main/_resources/introduction-to-git-and-github.md)

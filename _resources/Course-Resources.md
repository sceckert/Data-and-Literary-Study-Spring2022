The `plot()`  function in `pandas` has several basic plotting operations operations. Skim through the documentations to learn more about how to create the different kinds of visualizations: stacked bar charts, scatter plots, chart, etc: [https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html)

## Git and GitHub

	- GitHub's cheatsheet of git commands: ["Git Handbook"](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)
- ["Mastering Markdown"](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) (the language used in Markdown files (files ending .md) and in the prose portions of Jupyter Notebooks
- Create a GitHub website: ["Getting Started With GitHub Pages"](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) (Note that this is different than adding a Jupyter Notebook to a GitHub repository. Adding a Jupyter notebook or a .md file to a repository is another way of publishing your files.

I'm not sure whether the code accounts for that or if that's something that we need to account for when looking at the data. Either way, we are not getting the top 50 distinct books, but top 50 checkouts independently of title. It is not exactly what we asked for.

So we'd have to add together all copies of a particular title if we want the real \"top 50 most checked out titles\" as opposed to particular copies of those works."

    "Good!  And note that when we used the `seattle_library_df[seattle_library_df['Author'] == 'Baldiwn, James, 1924-1987']]` method, we were looking for all the rows where the author name appears in the \"Author\" column **exactly** as `Baldiwn, James, 1924-1987` (Do we know in advance that entries include his dates as well?). When we used the `seattle_library_df[seattle_library_df['Author'].str.contains('Baldwin, James', na=False)]` method, we were looking for all rows where the author name appears in the \"Author\" column containing at least the string \"Baldwin, James\" (but could potentially include other characters."

    "Close––you're almost there! What you've done is asked pandas to tell you whether or not a given row in the column \"Subjects\" contains the string 'African American authors'. In order to use this as a *filter* to generate a subset of our dataframe, we have to apply this filter as a condition to dataframe by nesting it inside brackets (along with flag to ignore `na` (blank) values). The general formula for applying a filter to a dataframe is `df[df['column'].some_function_or_condition_applied_to the_column_to_filter()]]`.\n",

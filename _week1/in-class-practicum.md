## Sentences in Conrad and Norris

We've read Edith Rickert's method for comparing and visualizing style in works of literature––what she calls "graphical and statistical methods"––using two short passages from Joseph Conrad and Frank Norris as examples. 

> The sky was a miracle of purity, a miracle of azure. The sea was polished, was blue, was pellucid, was sparkling like a precious stone, extending on all sides, all round to the horizon—as if the whole terrestrial globe had been one jewel, one colossal sapphire, a single gem fashioned into a planet.
> ––Joseph Conrad, *Youth* (1910)



> Every day and all day the same pale-blue sky and the un-
winking sun over the moving speck. Every day and all day the same black-blue water world untouched by any known wind, smooth as a slab of syenite, colourful as an opal, stretched out and around and beyond and before and behind us, forever, illimitable, empty.
>–––Frank Norris, “The Ship That Saw a Ghost,” A Deal in Wheat (1903)

1. Reread pages 5-15 of Rickert.
2. With your partner, come up with a list of other ways that we might compare the two passages through counting or visualization. 
	- (You might look at particular aspects of their form, imagery, sentence/word lengths, word choices, rhythm, or connective phrases).

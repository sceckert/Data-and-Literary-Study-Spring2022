    "In this homework, we're going to be learning how to use Python to perform some basic computational analysis of a text file and a small set of structured data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of what we'll be learning will build on [what we learned to do with the command line interface](https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/blob/main/_week1/introduction-to-the-command-line.md): perform basic searches across text, identify patterns, count words and lines. Python also allows us to far more robust analysis: we can write scripts that allow us to re-use code, manipulate and view data. \n"

    "## Before we get started... some Python and Jupyter Notebook Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a Jupyter Notebook. You can interact with it in a few ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can click on [the Binder version](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/main?urlpath=lab/tree/_week2/research-exercise-2.ipynb) (this is hosted on a cloud server)\n",
    "2. You can run on your own machine through Jupyter Labs: \n",
    "\t- Download this notebook and this folder of data. ( https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/archive/main.zip)\n",
    "\t- I encourage you to learn to create Jupyter notebooks on your own machine––this will give you a little more control over writing and saving your own Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Pro Tips:\n",
    "- Running a cell in JupyterLab: Click on the cell, then click ► (the \"Run\" icon) in the menu at the top of this notbook \n",
    "- `Tab` completion. \n",
    "    - Like the command line, Python uses tab completion\n",
    "    - Pressing the `tab` key on your on your keyboard will allow you to search for any variables that you've already defined, as well as matching functions or modules within python.\n",
    "- Run cells in order!\n",
    "    - Python executes code in the order that it's written. This means that some parts of code will depend on parts written earlier. If you get an error, it may mean that you simply haven't defined a variable or function. Make sure to run code in the sequence it's written.\n"

    "\n",
    "To submit your homework, save your answers in your Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1. If you are running JupyterLab off Binder (the cloud server interactive version)**:\n",
    "    - Make sure to SAVE and DOWNLOAD the notebook when you are done––the cloud server will not save your *any* of your changes!! \n",
    "    - To do this, go to the top menu in Jupyter Labs, click on the Save icon, and then and click on the \"Download\" button. This will download as a Notebook (.ipynb).  This is what you'll be turning in as your homework. \n",
    "![image](images/download.png)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- **2. If you would like to running JupyterLabs through your own Anaconda Navigator**:\n",
    "    - Download our course files: https://github.com/sceckert/Data-and-Literary-Study-Spring2022/archive/main.zip and unzip the folder somewhere on your desktop\n",
    "    - Launch Anaconda Navigator, then launch Jupyter Labs\n",
    "    - Once in Jupyter labs, navigate to the folder on your desktop with our course materials, then navigate into the directory called \"_week2\"\n",
    "    - To save any changes you make to the notebook, click on the Save icon.\n",

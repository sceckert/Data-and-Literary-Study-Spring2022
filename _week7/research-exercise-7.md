### How to Read a Finding Aid

What is a finding aid? A finding aid is a a document crated by an archivist (or archivists) to describe a collection. They offer an inventory or an index to the contents of a collection held in an institutional archive and help a researcher or user navigate the contents to find relevant material. Unlike offers in a library catalog


What's in a finding aid? Finding aids contain **collections**, which are organized into **series**, which contain "**items**" (often stored in boxes or folders) that can be request for review in a reading room. Take a few minutes to read this short [2018 infographic  "What is A Finding Aid?,"](https://www.bates.edu/archives/files/2018/05/What-is-a-finding-aid_.pdf), created by archivists at Bates College for their Archives and Special Collections Library.

Finding aids will be vary in terms of their level of detail––there may be items in a collection not covered in a finding aid! This is because archival science balances different impulses: giving detailed enough information about the contents of a particular collection and making as many collections as possible available for researchers. Typically, a given collection may contain subsidies (like "Correspondence" or "Writings", along with brief descriptions of groupings of contents).


Here's an example finding aid for the "Princeton University Library Collection of Children's Publishers' and Retailers' Catalogs, 1913-2015" :

+  "**Collection Creator**" - who assembled the materials together
+  "**Dates**" - the dates of material held in the collection
+  "**Extent**" - this is the size or scope of the collection
+  "**Languages**" - languages in the holdings
+  "**Description**" - a short description of the contents
+  " **Access Restrictions**" - a description of any restrictions to access
+  "**Credit this material**" - this is the citation format for the collection
+  A "**Content List**" - this lists the boxes where particular materials are to be found.

1. Go to the Princeton University Library Finding Aids catalog: https://findingaids.princeton.edu/
2. In the lefthand menu, under the "Repository" facet, select––depending your interests–– one of the divisions in Firestone Special Collections :
	+ ["Manuscripts Division"](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/?f%5Brepository_sim%5D%5B%5D=Manuscripts+Division&group=true&q=&search_field=all_fields) 
	+ or ["Rare Book Division"](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/?f%5Brepository_sim%5D%5B%5D=Rare+Book+Division&group=true&q=&search_field=all_fields) 
	+ or ["Latin American Ephemera Collections"](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/?f%5Brepository_sim%5D%5B%5D=Latin+American+Ephemera+Collections&group=true&q=&search_field=all_fields)
	+ or ["Cotsen Children's Library"](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/?f%5Brepository_sim%5D%5B%5D=Cotsen+Children%27s+Library&group=true&q=&search_field=all_fields)
